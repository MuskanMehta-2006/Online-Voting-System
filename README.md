# Online Voting System

The Online Voting System is a web-based platform designed to allow registered voters to securely cast their votes in elections. This system ensures a smooth and secure voting process, providing both voters and administrators with the necessary tools to manage and track the election.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can log in and manage voter registrations, view election results, and monitor voting activity.
- **Voter Authentication**: Voters can log in using their credentials to access the voting platform.
- **Vote Casting**: Registered voters can cast their votes for their preferred candidates.
- **Real-time Election Results**: Admins can view real-time results after voting ends.
- **Vote Tracking**: The system tracks all votes cast and ensures that each voter can vote only once.

The following files are included in this repository:

- **2.py**: Main Python script for the voting system backend (handles login, vote casting, etc.)
- **admin.txt**: A file that contains admin credentials for logging into the system.
